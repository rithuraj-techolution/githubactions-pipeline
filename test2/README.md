# Pandas Data Exploration

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library in Python. The `utils.py` file contains code examples for creating, manipulating, and extracting insights from a sample DataFrame.

## File Descriptions

### utils.py

**Purpose:** 
This file showcases fundamental Pandas operations for data exploration.

**Functions and Features:**

- **Creating a DataFrame:** Demonstrates creating a Pandas DataFrame from a dictionary.
- **Data Inspection:** Shows how to display the DataFrame.
- **Calculating Mean:** Illustrates calculating the mean of a column (`Age`).
- **Filtering Data:** Demonstrates filtering rows based on a condition (age greater than 25).
- **Adding a New Column:** Shows how to add a new column (`Age in 5 Years`) based on existing data.

**Dependencies:**
- pandas

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pandas library using pip: `pip install pandas`

## Usage Guide

1. Run the `utils.py` script using Python: `python utils.py`
2. The script will print the sample DataFrame, mean age, filtered DataFrame, and the DataFrame with the added column.

## Examples

The `utils.py` file itself contains practical examples of each function and operation.

## How the Files Relate

The `README.md` file provides documentation for the `utils.py` file, explaining its purpose, functionality, and how to use it.
