# Python Project with Standalone Files

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Python project structure with multiple standalone files, each serving a distinct purpose. The project utilizes the `colorama` library for colored output.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `main.py`

- **Purpose**: This is the main script of the project. It demonstrates the usage of the `colorama` library to print colored text to the console.

- **Functions and Features**:
    - It imports the `Fore` class from the `colorama` library.
    - Uses `Fore.RED` and `Fore.RESET` to print "Hello World" in red color.

- **Dependencies**:
    - `colorama`

### 2. `utils.py`

- **Purpose**: This file contains a set of utility functions for arithmetic operations.

- **Functions and Features**:
    - `add(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
    - `subtract(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.
    - `multiply(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
    - `divide(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input, divides the first by the second, and returns the quotient. Raises a `ValueError` if the second number is zero.

- **Dependencies**: None

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. **Running the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will print "Hello World" in red color to the console.

2. **Using the utility functions**:
   You can import the functions from `utils.py` into other scripts or a Python interpreter session and use them directly. For example:
   ```python
   from utils import add, subtract, multiply, divide

   result = add(5, 3)
   print(result)  # Output: 8
   ```

## Examples

```python
from utils import multiply

result = multiply(4, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 28
```

## How the Files Relate

- `main.py` demonstrates the use of a third-party library (`colorama`) and serves as an entry point to the project.
- `utils.py` provides reusable utility functions that can be used by other parts of the project.
