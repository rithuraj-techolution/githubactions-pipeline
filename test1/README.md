# Basic Math Operations Project

## Overview

This project provides a simple Python utility for basic arithmetic operations. The utility functions are designed to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers and handle basic error checking, such as division by zero.

## File Descriptions

### README.md
- **Purpose**: Provides an overview and documentation for the project.

### utils.py
- **Purpose**: Contains functions for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Functions and Features**:
  - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference when `b` is subtracted from `a`.
  - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
  - `divide(a, b)`: Returns the division of `a` by `b`. Raises a `ValueError` if `b` is zero.
- **Dependencies**: None beyond Python standard library.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download `utils.py` to your local machine.

## Usage Guide

Use the functions by importing `utils.py` into your Python script or interactive shell:
```python
from utils import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Examples
result1 = add(5, 3)
result2 = subtract(10, 4)
result3 = multiply(7, 6)
result4 = divide(8, 2) # Be cautious to ensure second argument isn't zero

print(result1, result2, result3, result4)
```

## Examples

Here's a demonstration of how to use the `utils.py` functions:
```python
print(add(10, 5))        # Output: 15
print(subtract(10, 5))   # Output: 5
print(multiply(10, 5))   # Output: 50
print(divide(10, 5))     # Output: 2.0
```

## How the Files Relate

- `README.md` documents the project, while `utils.py` is the functional core, providing the basic operations.
