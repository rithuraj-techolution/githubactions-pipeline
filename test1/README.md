# Calculator

## Overview

This project contains a Python file (`utils.py`) that provides basic arithmetic operations.

## File Descriptions

### utils.py

- **Purpose:** Provides functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Functions and Features:**

    - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
    - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between two numbers.
    - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of two numbers.
    - `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of two numbers. Raises a `ValueError` if the divisor is zero.

    **Example:**
    ```python
    result = add(5, 3)
    print(result)  # Output: 8
    ```

- **Dependencies:** None

## Setup Instructions

No specific setup is required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage Guide

Import the desired functions from the `utils.py` file into your Python script.

```python
from utils import add, subtract, multiply, divide
```

## Examples

```python
from utils import *

# Perform arithmetic operations
print(add(10, 5))      # Output: 15
print(subtract(10, 5))   # Output: 5
print(multiply(10, 5))   # Output: 50
print(divide(10, 5))   # Output: 2.0
```

## How the Files Relate

The `utils.py` file can be imported into other Python scripts to utilize its arithmetic functions.
