# Project Title

Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Overview

This project provides a simple utility for performing basic arithmetic operations. The `utils.py` file contains functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to be a standalone module that can be integrated into larger projects requiring mathematical calculations.

## File Descriptions

### `utils.py`

- **Purpose**: 
  - To perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Functions and Features**:
  - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
    - **Inputs**: Two numbers, `a` and `b`.
    - **Output**: The sum of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `add(2, 3)` returns `5`.
  - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference when `b` is subtracted from `a`.
    - **Inputs**: Two numbers, `a` and `b`.
    - **Output**: The difference between `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `subtract(5, 3)` returns `2`.
  - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
    - **Inputs**: Two numbers, `a` and `b`.
    - **Output**: The product of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `multiply(4, 3)` returns `12`.
  - `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Raises a `ValueError` for division by zero.
    - **Inputs**: Two numbers, `a` and `b`.
    - **Output**: The quotient of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `divide(10, 2)` returns `5`.
    - **Special Cases**: Raises `ValueError` if `b` is `0`.
  
- **Dependencies**: 
  - None

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository containing `utils.py` to your local environment.

## Usage Guide

To use the functions in `utils.py`, import them into your Python script:

```python
from utils import add, subtract, multiply, divide

result = add(2, 3)
```

## Examples

```python
print(add(5, 2))          # Output: 7
print(subtract(10, 5))    # Output: 5
print(multiply(3, 3))     # Output: 9
print(divide(9, 3))       # Output: 3 
```

## How the Files Relate

Since this is a single-file project, there are no interdependencies between different files. `utils.py` serves as a standalone utility module.
