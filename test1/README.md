# Basic Calculator Functions

## Overview
This project contains basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## File Descriptions

### File Name: calculator.py
**Purpose**: Provides basic arithmetic operations.

#### Functions and Features

- **`add(a, b)`**
  - **Purpose**: Adds two numbers.
  - **Input Parameters**: `a` (int or float), `b` (int or float)
  - **Expected Output**: Sum of `a` and `b`
  - **Example Usage**:
    ```python
    result = add(2, 3)  # result = 5
    ```
    
- **`subtract(a, b)`**
  - **Purpose**: Subtracts one number from another.
  - **Input Parameters**: `a` (int or float), `b` (int or float)
  - **Expected Output**: Difference between `a` and `b`
  - **Example Usage**:
    ```python
    result = subtract(5, 2)  # result = 3
    ```
    
- **`multiply(a, b)`**
  - **Purpose**: Multiplies two numbers.
  - **Input Parameters**: `a` (int or float), `b` (int or float)
  - **Expected Output**: Product of `a` and `b`
  - **Example Usage**:
    ```python
    result = multiply(3, 4)  # result = 12
    ```

- **`divide(a, b)`**
  - **Purpose**: Divides one number by another.
  - **Input Parameters**: `a` (int or float), `b` (int or float, not zero)
  - **Expected Output**: Quotient of `a` and `b`
  - **Exceptions**: Raises `ValueError` if `b` is zero.
  - **Example Usage**:
    ```python
    result = divide(10, 2)  # result = 5
    ```

#### Dependencies
No external libraries required.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the `calculator.py` file.

## Usage Guide
Run each function by importing the `calculator.py` file in your Python script.

## Examples
You can test the functions by calling them with different arguments.

## How the Files Relate
All functions are standalone within `calculator.py` and do not depend on each other.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes.

#### Overview
This project provides basic arithmetic operations encapsulated in individual functions. These functions allow users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numeric inputs.

#### File Descriptions

- **File Name**: `arithmetic_operations.py`
  - **Purpose**: Contains functions to perform basic arithmetic operations.
  - **Functions and Features**:
    - **`add(a, b)`**:
      - **Purpose**: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
      - **Input**: `a` (number), `b` (number)
      - **Output**: Sum of `a` and `b`.
      - **Example Usage**:
        ```python
        result = add(5, 3)  # result is 8
        ```
    - **`subtract(a, b)`**:
      - **Purpose**: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
      - **Input**: `a` (number), `b` (number)
      - **Output**: Difference of `a` and `b`.
      - **Example Usage**:
        ```python
        result = subtract(5, 3)  # result is 2
        ```
    - **`multiply(a, b)`**:
      - **Purpose**: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
      - **Input**: `a` (number), `b` (number)
      - **Output**: Product of `a` and `b`.
      - **Example Usage**:
        ```python
        result = multiply(5, 3)  # result is 15
        ```
    - **`divide(a, b)`**:
      - **Purpose**: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Raises an error for division by zero.
      - **Input**: `a` (number), `b` (number)
      - **Output**: Quotient of `a` and `b`.
      - **Example Usage**:
        ```python
        result = divide(5, 2)  # result is 2.5
        ```

  - **Dependencies**: None. This file does not require any external libraries.

#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the `arithmetic_operations.py` file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).

#### Usage Guide
Run Python and import the functions from `arithmetic_operations.py`:

```python
from arithmetic_operations import add, subtract, multiply, divide

print(add(5, 3))
```

#### Examples
- **Addition**:
  ```python
  print(add(1, 2))  # Output: 3
  ```
- **Subtraction**:
  ```python
  print(subtract(5, 3))  # Output: 2
  ```

#### How the Files Relate
All functions are independent and provide core arithmetic capabilities. They don't depend on each other but are designed to be used together as a complete arithmetic toolbox.
