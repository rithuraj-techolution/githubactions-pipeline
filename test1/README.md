# Project Title: Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Overview
This project provides basic arithmetic operations to perform simple mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation is implemented as a standalone function within the `utils.py` file, aiding in easy integration and reuse in other projects requiring basic math functions.

## File Descriptions

### File: `utils.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements basic arithmetic functions.
- **Functions and Features**:
  - **add(a, b)**
    - **Purpose**: Adds two numbers.
    - **Inputs**: 
      - `a` (number): First operand
      - `b` (number): Second operand
    - **Outputs**: Sum of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `add(3, 5)` returns `8`.
  
  - **subtract(a, b)**
    - **Purpose**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
    - **Inputs**: 
      - `a` (number): Minuend
      - `b` (number): Subtrahend
    - **Outputs**: Difference of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `subtract(10, 4)` returns `6`.

  - **multiply(a, b)**
    - **Purpose**: Multiplies two numbers.
    - **Inputs**:
      - `a` (number): First operand
      - `b` (number): Second operand
    - **Outputs**: Product of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `multiply(6, 7)` returns `42`.

  - **divide(a, b)**
    - **Purpose**: Divides the first number by the second.
    - **Inputs**:
      - `a` (number): Dividend
      - `b` (number): Divisor
    - **Outputs**: Quotient of `a` and `b`.
    - **Example**: `divide(20, 4)` returns `5.0`.
    - **Note**: Raises a `ValueError` if `b` is zero.

- **Dependencies**: None

## Setup Instructions
No installation setup is required for `utils.py` as it has no external dependencies.

## Usage Guide
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Import the `utils.py` file in your Python script or interactive session.
   ```python
   from utils import add, subtract, multiply, divide
   ```
3. Call the desired function with appropriate arguments.
   ```python
   result = add(2, 3)
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

## Examples
- Adding two numbers:
  ```python
  print(add(1, 2))  # Output: 3
  ```
- Subtracting:
  ```python
  print(subtract(5, 3))  # Output: 2
  ```

## How the Files Relate
Since the project currently encompasses only `utils.py`, it serves as the central file for performing and demonstrating arithmetic operations.
